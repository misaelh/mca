%% This section is called the preamble, where we can specify which
%% latex packages we required.  Most (but not of all) of the packages
%% below should be fairly standard in most latex documents.  The
%% exception is xspace and the new \latex command, which you probably
%% do not need.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Better math support:
\usepackage{amsmath}

%% Bibliography style:
\usepackage{mathptmx}           % Use the Times font.
\usepackage{graphicx}           % Needed for including graphics.
\usepackage{url}                % Facility for activating URLs.

%% Set the paper size to be A4, with a 2cm margin 
%% all around the page.
\usepackage[a4paper,margin=2cm]{geometry}

%% Natbib is a popular style for formatting references.
\usepackage{natbib}
%% bibpunct sets the punctuation used for formatting citations.
\bibpunct{(}{)}{;}{a}{,}{,}

%% textcomp provides extra control sequences for accessing text symbols:
\usepackage{textcomp}
\newcommand*{\micro}{\textmu}
%% Here, we define the \micro command to print a text "mu".
%% "\newcommand" returns an error if "\micro" is already defined.

%% This is an example of a new macro that I've created to save me
%% having to type \LaTeX each time.  The xspace command provides space
%% after the word LaTeX where appropriate.
\usepackage{xspace}
\providecommand*{\latex}{\LaTeX\xspace}
%% "\providecommand" does nothing if "\latex" is already defined.

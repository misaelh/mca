% IEEEtran V1.7 and later provides for these CLASSINPUT macros to allow the
% user to reprogram some IEEEtran.cls defaults if needed. These settings
% override the internal defaults of IEEEtran.cls regardless of which class
% options are used. Do not use these unless you have good reason to do so as
% they can result in nonIEEE compliant documents. User beware. ;)

%\newcommand{\CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch}{1.0} % baselinestretch
%\newcommand{\CLASSINPUTinnersidemargin}{1in} % inner side margin

% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[12pt,journal,compsoc]{IEEEtran}
% The Computer Society requires 12pt.
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[10pt,journal,compsoc]{../sty/IEEEtran}


% For Computer Society journals, IEEEtran defaults to the use of 
% Palatino/Palladio as is done in IEEE Computer Society journals.
% To go back to Times Roman, you can use this code:
%\renewcommand{\rmdefault}{ptm}\selectfont





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)



% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  % \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  % \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later.
%
% Note also the use of a CLASSOPTION conditional provided by 
% IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{float}

\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  %\renewcommand{\figurename{Figure}}
  % \addto\captionsenglish{\renewcommand{\figurename}{}}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage{acronym}
% acronym.sty was written by Tobias Oetiker. This package provides tools for
% managing documents with large numbers of acronyms. (You don't *have* to
% use this package - unless you have a lot of acronyms, you may feel that
% such package management of them is bit of an overkill.)
% Do note that the acronym environment (which lists acronyms) will have a
% problem when used under IEEEtran.cls because acronym.sty relies on the
% description list environment - which IEEEtran.cls has customized for
% producing IEEE style lists. A workaround is to declared the longest
% label width via the IEEEtran.cls \IEEEiedlistdecl global control:
%
% \renewcommand{\IEEEiedlistdecl}{\IEEEsetlabelwidth{SONET}}
% \begin{acronym}
%
% \end{acronym}
% \renewcommand{\IEEEiedlistdecl}{\relax}% remember to reset \IEEEiedlistdecl
%
% instead of using the acronym environment's optional argument.
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/acronym/


%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.


% NOTE: PDF thumbnail features are not required in IEEE papers
%       and their use requires extra complexity and work.
%\ifCLASSINFOpdf
%  \usepackage[pdftex]{thumbpdf}
%\else
%  \usepackage[dvips]{thumbpdf}
%\fi
% thumbpdf.sty and its companion Perl utility were written by Heiko Oberdiek.
% It allows the user a way to produce PDF documents that contain fancy
% thumbnail images of each of the pages (which tools like acrobat reader can
% utilize). This is possible even when using dvi->ps->pdf workflow if the
% correct thumbpdf driver options are used. thumbpdf.sty incorporates the
% file containing the PDF thumbnail information (filename.tpm is used with
% dvips, filename.tpt is used with pdftex, where filename is the base name of
% your tex document) into the final ps or pdf output document. An external
% utility, the thumbpdf *Perl script* is needed to make these .tpm or .tpt
% thumbnail files from a .ps or .pdf version of the document (which obviously
% does not yet contain pdf thumbnails). Thus, one does a:
% 
% thumbpdf filename.pdf 
%
% to make a filename.tpt, and:
%
% thumbpdf --mode dvips filename.ps
%
% to make a filename.tpm which will then be loaded into the document by
% thumbpdf.sty the NEXT time the document is compiled (by pdflatex or
% latex->dvips->ps2pdf). Users must be careful to regenerate the .tpt and/or
% .tpm files if the main document changes and then to recompile the
% document to incorporate the revised thumbnails to ensure that thumbnails
% match the actual pages. It is easy to forget to do this!
% 
% Unix systems come with a Perl interpreter. However, MS Windows users
% will usually have to install a Perl interpreter so that the thumbpdf
% script can be run. The Ghostscript PS/PDF interpreter is also required.
% See the thumbpdf docs for details. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at.
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/thumbpdf/


% NOTE: PDF hyperlink and bookmark features are not required in IEEE
%       papers and their use requires extra complexity and work.

%\fi
% One significant drawback of using hyperref under DVI output is that the
% LaTeX compiler cannot break URLs across lines or pages as can be done
% under pdfLaTeX's PDF output via the hyperref pdftex driver. This is
% probably the single most important capability distinction between the
% DVI and PDF output. Perhaps surprisingly, all the other PDF features
% (PDF bookmarks, thumbnails, etc.) can be preserved in
% .tex->.dvi->.ps->.pdf workflow if the respective packages/scripts are
% loaded/invoked with the correct driver options (dvips, etc.)F. 
% As most IEEE papers use URLs sparingly (mainly in the references), this
% may not be as big an issue as with other publications.
%
% That said, Vilar Camara Neto created his breakurl.sty package which
% permits hyperref to easily break URLs even in dvi mode.
% Note that breakurl, unlike most other packages, must be loaded
% AFTER hyperref. The latest version of breakurl and its documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/breakurl/
% breakurl.sty is not for use under pdflatex pdf mode.
%
% The advanced features offer by hyperref.sty are not required for IEEE
% submission, so users should weigh these features against the added
% complexity of use.
% The package options above demonstrate how to enable PDF bookmarks
% (a type of table of contents viewable in Acrobat Reader) as well as
% PDF document information (title, subject, author and keywords) that is
% viewable in Acrobat reader's Document_Properties menu. PDF document
% information is also used extensively to automate the cataloging of PDF
% documents. The above set of options ensures that hyperlinks will not be
% colored in the text and thus will not be visible in the printed page,
% but will be active on "mouse over". USING COLORS OR OTHER HIGHLIGHTING
% OF HYPERLINKS CAN RESULT IN DOCUMENT REJECTION BY THE IEEE, especially if
% these appear on the "printed" page. IF IN DOUBT, ASK THE RELEVANT
% SUBMISSION EDITOR. You may need to add the option hypertexnames=false if
% you used duplicate equation numbers, etc., but this should not be needed
% in normal IEEE work.
% The latest version of hyperref and its documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/hyperref/





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***

%
%
% author names and IEEE memberships

% two lines.
% use \thanks{} to gain access to the first footnote area

%
%
%\IEEEcompsocitemizethanks is a special \thanks that produces the bulleted
% lists the Computer Society journals use for "first footnote" author
% affiliations. Use \IEEEcompsocthanksitem which works much like \item
% for each affiliation group. When not in compsoc mode,
% \IEEEcompsocitemizethanks becomes like \thanks and
% \IEEEcompsocthanksitem becomes a line break with idention. This
% facilitates dual compilation, although admittedly the differences in the
% desired content of \author between the different types of papers makes a
% one-size-fits-all approach a daunting prospect. For instance, compsoc 
% journal papers have the author affiliations above the "Manuscript
% received ..."  text while in non-compsoc journals this is reversed. Sigh.

\author{The authors}

% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks - 
% these prevent an unwanted space from occurring between the last author name

% 
% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.

\indent Recent developments start to show a modest but solid deviation to the well-known Gordon Moore's 40-year old law that talks about performance improvement in CPU processing power. Even though the mentioned law got several interpretations, only one seems to be able to keep up with the projected trend: the increase in number of transistor per die area (expected to double every 18-24 months). However, as we approach the limits of current Silicon manufacturing technologies, even that trend is threatened to flatten, not only because of the pure physical constraints (we are reaching manufacturing precisions of atoms), but also because of the more significant quantum phenomena that starts to be exhibited when talking about devices like SET (single-electron transistors).

One of the most important aspects left aside in the childhood of computing ages was the memory-barrier, probably the biggest constraint a computing system faces nowadays. There is a well known chart that addresses this issue, which shows that the memory - CPU gap also grows at an exponential rate. In other terms, this issue has a massive impact in CPU performance and further threatens to clutter the horizon of exponential innovation for the field of artificial intelligence and computing systems.

The complexity of the issue grows further with recent developments with heterogeneous SoC, because of integrating a bandwidth-hungry multi-core GPU on the same die. Although a higher level of integration can provide improvements in many areas, such as portability, power-efficiency and cost-efficiency, the bandwidth and latency challenges still remain and can truly bottleneck one of the two main components, regarding the provided scenario.

\section{Problems}
The main part of a conventional computing system architecture is comprised of a computing unit, it's physical memory, virtual memory and the data transfer buses between all of them. In order to keep up with the evolving state of processing power, memory hierarchy started to become more complex. Nowadays, SoCs include up to three levels of Cache memory, built as SRAM memory. The cache is tightly coupled with the compute units and is usually structured in two levels (L1 and L2). After 2003, Intel also integrated the LLC (last-level cache - also referred as L3) on the chip die, forcing motherboard vendors to remove it from their products. This solution reduced the latency and provided space for higher bandwidth, while decreasing miss rate slowdown.

As of 2009, for means of tighter integration and power consumption, consumer CPUs have started to engulf some GPU processing cores. The solution brought many innovations in the field, but also gave birth to several challenges to computer engineers and software architects. 

The biggest problems of such a high-level of integration are the memory management, bandwidth and latency. The issue grows further in complexity because the memory requirements do not scale in a linear manner, but more agressively due to the combined needs the two processors exhibit (the GPU and CPU); while the conventional main-purpose processor needs low-latency memory and moderate bandwidth, the GPU is not affected by a high latency, while the bandwidth requirements can be an order of magnitude bigger. 
\subsection{DRAM limitations in mobile devices}
The emerging market of mobile devices uses tightly integrated hardware for addressing the consumer's needs in terms of portability, processing power and energy consumption. The trend for smartphones and tablets has only one direction: slimmer and lighter devices. This trend forces a shrink on every subcomponent or a greater efficiency. While battery needs also to shrink (the LiPo capacity has a very low improvement rate), the energy consumption has to decrease without significantly influencing the processing improvement trend. 

Strictly speaking, a device's main memory needs to have greater capacity in smaller packages with lower energy consumption. Although the improvement in bandwidth is projected for another decade (LPDDR4 and its descendants), the power and area constraints push more and more against this technology.
\subsection{Cache line allocation in shared LLC}
Many modern solutions are starting to integrate CPUs and GPUs in the same die. For easier and cheaper integration into the existent memory architecture, both types of cores share the last-level cache. Most cache replacement policies were designed for homogeneous configurations, so they are not efficient in these cases.

Policies like LRU and DDRIP will favor the GPUs when allocating cache lines due to the fact that their memory access rates are orders of magnitude higher than the CPUs. GPU applications tend to be more latency tolerant while CPU ones are more latency intolerant. So favoring GPUs in cache allocation cause a considerable decrease in the CPUs IPC, while the GPUs IPC is only marginally improved. The ideal cache replacement policy would take into consideration the latency requirements of most CPU applications by ensuring their blocks last longer in the cache.
A replacement policy that takes this

\subsection{Memory scheduling}
When a CPU and GPU are integrated on the same chip and share the same off-chip memory the bandwidth demanding GPU can starve the cores of the CPU on lead to a all over poor system performance \cite{SmS}.  State of the art memory controllers (MC) have mainly been focused on a multi-core CPUs and not on the joint venture of CPU-GPU SoCs.  To make the applications-aware memory scheduling work on GPU-CPU SoC a very large request buffer is needed.

Figure~\ref{fig:buff}(a) shows the request buffer of a memory controller where there is only a multi-core CPU.  The MC has a good overview over
numerous requests from the CPU cores and inside into their memory behavior.  When the buffer is shared between the GPU and CPU, as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:buff}(b) the requests from the GPU limit the MC capability of insight into the behavior of requests from the CPU cores.  Figure~\ref{fig:buff}(c) shows larger request buffer so that the MC can observer more requests from the CPU.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
	\includegraphics[width = 8 cm]{graphics/no1.png}
	\caption{Limited visibility example due to small buffer size. (a) CPU-only
	case, (b) MC’s visibility when CPU and GPU are combined, (c) Improved
	visibility with a larger request buffer.\cite{SmS}}\label{fig:buff}
\end{figure} 

The increased buffer size does not come without a cost. It increases circuit complexity and results in a significant larger die area. The larger request buffer also leads to higher power consumption and increased costs \cite{SmS} making it an unattractive solution. 

\section{Solutions}
\subsection{Cache line allocation in shared LLC}
The proposed solution is a new cache management policy called HeLM (Heterogeneous LLC Management). It consists on measuring the cache sensitivity of the GPU and CPU, and based on a couple of thresholds decide if GPU access requests to the LLC should be bypassed directly to the main memory or not.
It is based on the fact that GPUs have a much higher TLP than CPUs, and thus are less affected by longer memory access latency. Having a high TLP means that there will most likely be some threads that can be ran while waiting for the memory to respond. If that is the case, bypassing the cache should not affect the IPC count.

<<<<<<< HEAD
\subsection{Hybrid-technology memory system}
A proposed solution that addresses the DRAM limitations is a hybrid DRAM/PRAM-based Main Memory. PRAM is a type of non-volatile RAM which stores information as phase-state in a cell. The PRAM’s main advantages over DRAM  are the better-scaling projections and the low idle-power consumption. However, because of the low writing endurance and high-latency for writes, the technology is not a valid replacement for DRAM, being best suited to complement it in the critical points (storage and power consumption).

Combining the benefits of the two technologies, the authors proposed two types of the hybrid system that can hide their weak points. 

First variant is a hierarchical-topology organization, where the DRAM plays the role of a Last-Level Cache and the PRAM is the main memory. However, when regarding the CPU’s needs, a LLC miss would involve a very high latency for fetching the needed data from the main memory. In the projected case, 40 us for retrieving unused data from the PRAM transforms into 40.000 cycles for a 1 GHz CPU, an overhead too big for any out-of-order execution mechanism, assuring a deep stall on every processing unit, thus considerably reducing the IPC count.

The second approach is a flat organization of the two technologies, with the DRAM mainly serving the CPU purposes, and the PRAM meant for the GPU side. This kind of implementation has several advantages over the hierarchical:
\begin{itemize}
\item
It eliminates the issue of very high miss penalty on the LLC (DRAM for that proposal).
\item
It separates the memory-buses, avoiding possible GPU-CPU conflicts in critical points, such as the synchronization of complex CPU applications with memory-hungry GPU activity.
\end{itemize}
=======
To calculate cache sensitivity in the GPUs, set dueling is used. The GPUs TLP is measured as the amount of wavefronts ready to be scheduled. This information is sent along with the LLC access request whenever there is an L1 cache miss. One GPU core is set to do a cache bypass whenever it's TLP is higher than a lowThreshold. Another one is set to do the same but with highThreshold. IPC is measured for both cores and if the difference is higher than pThreshold, the highThreshold is used for the remaining cores.

In the case of the CPUs, the cache misses on the LLC are measured with both lowThreshold and highThreshold bypassing of the GPUs. If the difference in cache misses is higher than mThreshold, the threshold of the GPUs is overridden to be the lowThreshold.

What all this means is that the CPU will be given preference over the GPU in cache allocation. The GPU will be frequently bypassing the LLC cache, specially if its TLP is high. So a penalty in the GPUs IPC is expected. However the CPU IPC is expected to see the most change, since the GPU bypassing of the LLC means the CPU will get more sets for its use.

A comparison to other cache management policies was made with 3 different configurations: 1, 2 and 4 CPU cores, each with 4 GPU cores. A different random benchmark on each CPU core was run, and a random benchmark for all 4 GPUs. For each configuration, the benchmark was changed 100, 40 and 30 times respectively. The reduction of cache misses and speedup was calculated relative to LRU results. Figure~\ref{fig:comp} shows the comparison.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width = 8 cm]{graphics/LLCresults.png}
	\caption{Percentage reduction in misses and percentage speedup in the CPUs and the GPUs caused by HeLM and other cache management policies in comparison to LRU}\label{fig:comp}
\end{figure} 

As can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:comp} HeLM offer a considerably higher reduction in cache misses and overall speedup for the CPUs. On the GPUs, however, the effect is the opposite, although it is important to notice that a huge increase in misses for the GPU didn't affect so negatively the speedup. To provide a more general overview, the results for CPUs and GPUs were combined into Figure~\ref{fig:comp1}.

	\includegraphics[width = 8 cm]{graphics/LLCresults2.png}
	\caption{Combined percentage speedup of HeLM and other cache management policies in comparison to LRU}\label{fig:comp1}
\end{figure} 

As seen on Figure~\ref{fig:comp1} the overall speedup of HeLM is very noticeable even though it caused a huge amount of misses on the GPU requests. This is because GPU programs are much less sensible to the cache than CPU programs.

\subsection{Staged memory scheduling}
The proposed solution is a new memory controller (MC), Staged Memory Scheduling (SMS),  that is a simpler implementation in hardware and provides performance and fairness improvements over the application-aware MC.  It is split into three stages, the batch formation, batch scheduler and a DRAM command scheduler.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width = 8 cm]{graphics/SmS.png}
	\caption{organization of the SMS \cite{SmS}}
\end{figure}

Batch formation groups requests from the same application that access the same row.  This is done to increase row-buffer locality.  The second stage , the batch scheduler, schedules batches from different applications and the third stage, the DRAM Command Scheduler schedules requests while satisfying all DRAM constrains. More or less directly from the paper.  Needs good rewriting. 

Stage 1: Is built from simple FIFO structures that have one structure per sources.  One source is a single CPU-core or the GPU.  One batch is one or more memory requests from the same source that request access to the same DRAM row.  A batch is only ready when a request to a new DRAM row comes in, it is full or when the oldest request in the batch has exceeded a predefined age threshold.  A batch that is considered ready moves to stage 2 the Batch scheduler.

Stage 2:  The Batch Scheduler operates in two states, the pick  and the  drain.  In the pick state in picks a batch from stage 1 and than enters drain state where it feeds the FIFO batch to DRAM Command Scheduler one request per clock cycle until the whole batch is gone.  The picking is done in one of two fashions.  It picks the batch using either round-robin policy or shortest job first (SJF).   SJF tends to favor latency-sensitive applications that tend to have fewer total requests and thus favoring the CPU over the GPU.  On the other hand the round-robin simply picks the next ready batch in a round-robin manner and thus servicing high memory-intensive applications and favoring the GPU over the CPU.  The batch scheduler uses SJF with a probability of $p$ and round-robin  $ 1 - p $ which will be explained better later.

Stage 3: DRAM Command Scheduler (DCS) consists of few FIFO queues or one per DRAM bank.  Since the row-buffer locality from stage 1 has been preserved the only job of the DCS is to issue low-level DRAM commands and ensuring DRAM protocol compliance. 

Some batches bypass stage 1 and 2 and go directly to the DCS. Latency-sensitive requests of applications with low memory-intensity and all requests wen the system is lightly loaded, that is when total number of in-flight requests over all sources in the DCS are fewer the 16.\\

The probability parameter $p$:  As stated above the probability of SJF used is $p$ and that of round-robin policy $1-p$.  Therefor the value of $p$ determines  which gets higher priority, the CPU or the
GPU.  That is when $p$ is high the SJF policy is performed more frequently then round-robin and therefore favoring less memory-intensive applications of the CPU over the GPU.  And on the other hand when p is low request batches are scheduled more often in round-robin fashion favoring memory-intensive applications of the GPU over the CPU.  As different systems have different performance needs it is proposed to have $p$ a dynamic parameter that can be tuned to the needs of different systems.\\

\textbf{Hardware Implementation}
Batch Formation:  The hardware implementation for stage can be of a fairly simple nature as it only needs one comparator per source.  A new request has only to be checked if it can fit in the existing batch or not.  That is if the incoming request row index is the same as the last request that entered the batch.  The hardware overhead can be seen in Table \ref{tab:SmS1}

	\end{tabular}
	
  \end{minipage} }
  \caption{Storage Overhead of Stage 1: Batch formation stage \cite{SmS}}\label{tab:SmS1}
\end{table}

Batch Scheduler:  The batch scheduler does not need to be very complex as it only schedules FIFOS that are as many as there are sources or cores.  When SJF is applied a tree of MIN operators can be build from the out standing batches.  As the batches are not many the tree will not get very large. The hardware overhead can be seen in Table \ref{tab:SmS2}

\begin{table}[H]

		GPU memory request counter 			& $N_{GPU} × log_2 Count_{max\_GPU} = 10 bits$ 						\\\hline	
	\end{tabular}
  \end{minipage} }
  \caption{Storage Overhead of Stage 2: Batch Schedule \cite{SmS}}\label{tab:SmS2}
\end{table}

DRAM Command Scheduler:   Compared to the monolithic scheduler the DRAM command scheduler is on completely different scale.  It consist of per-bank FIFOs, eight per rank for DDR3, and only needs to look at the head of one. The hardware overhead can be seen in Table \ref{tab:SmS3}
